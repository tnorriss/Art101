                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> One of the problems we faced was that the button's action wasn't working for us.
                        We realized that we needed to put the event listener and the listener callback within one function. </p>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p> We were able to get the button to work properly with the random text! 
                        This lab made us further realize the importance of having the corrrect function structure.
