                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>This lab was harder for us because we aren't used to working with loops, especcially when we had to code a way for the script to recognize when 
                      a number is divisible by 3,5, or 7. We had to figure out which loop function would work best for this, which was challenging for us.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This lab seemed more like a puzzle than the other labs. When we started out, we had to choose the appropiate loop function
                    by breaking down concepts we learned in class. Overall, this lab helped us further understand the difference between loops and for loops.
