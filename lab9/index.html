                    <p>Initially I had difficulty in getting my button functions to work. I was able to collaborate with my partner in order to identify why they were not working. It becomes a lot easier to designate a problem in code when a correct one is used to cross examine.   </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="Problems">
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>While I was getting aorund to figuring out why my button functions did not work, I realized my actual funciton for the button was not doing anyything, although it appeared.   </p>

            <div class="minor-section" id="Reflection">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>I am excited to be adding more in depth abilities to my functions aside from basic sorting. I am starting to see the creative aspect behind all of the technicaliites of code.    </p>
