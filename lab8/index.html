                    <p>I learned a lot thorugh this lab while I was working on my own after having collobarated on the first submission. It was easier to comprehend the stpes I was doing as the difficulty we had before was completely bypassed having ofund the solution this time around. I did have difficulty with linking my CSS stylesheet to my html, which prompted me to change the formatting of the html.  </p>
