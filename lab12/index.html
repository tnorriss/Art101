                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>One of the challenegs we faced was creating the sorting hat function.
                    To do this we had to first break down in words what we were going to do for the code.
                This made it a lot easier for us to use the conditionnal and broke down something that seemed challebnging into something really simple</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This lab was definently more challenging for us then the last lab as it required us to use the new code.
                    We are excited to learn code that can make writing out the conditional less tedious. 
                    We were very happy to see our code working perfectly, especcially since it was Harry Potter themed.
