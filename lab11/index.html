                    <p> To work with a partner and experiment with different Javascript events .</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> I had problems when I went to copy the code into my own, as I always forget that my file locations will be different from my partners, as we titled our local files differently.  
                         </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p> I am still debating on if I want to rename my local files to prevent the working backwards on a project that has already been completed for the most part. By the time I get to the end of the code it becomes harder to identify where the missing bracket, or wrong format of a file name may be hiding!

                    <p> Here are the results!</p>
